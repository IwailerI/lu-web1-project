            <h2>BrainFunk language</h2>
            <p>
                Excerpt from <a id="source" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfunk">wikipedia</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                BrainFunk is an esoteric, imperative, structured, typeless programming language created in 1993 by Swiss
                student Urban MÃ¼ller with the name slightly changed. Designed to be extremely minimalistic, the language
                consists of only eight simple commands, a data pointer, and an instruction pointer.
            </p>

            <p>
                BrainFunk is an example of a so-called Turing tarpit: it can be used to write any program, but it is not
                practical to do so because it provides so little abstraction that the programs get very long or
                complicated.
                While BrainFunk is fully Turing-complete, it is not intended for practical use but to challenge and
                amuse
                programmers. BrainFunk requires one to break down commands into small and simple instructions.
            </p>

            <h2>Design</h2>

            <p>
                The language consists of eight commands. A BrainFunk program is a sequence of these commands, possibly
                interspersed with other characters (which are ignored). The commands are executed sequentially, with
                some exceptions: an instruction pointer begins at the first command, and each command it points to is
                executed, after which it normally moves forward to the next command. The program terminates when the
                instruction pointer moves past the last command.

                The BrainFunk language uses a simple machine model consisting of the program and instruction pointer, as
                well as a one-dimensional array of byte cells initialized to zero; a movable data
                pointer (initialized to point to the leftmost byte of the array); and two streams of bytes for input and
                output (most often connected to a keyboard and a monitor respectively, and using the ASCII character
                encoding). Original version specified a constant memory size of 30000, but this implementation relaxes
                this limitation, memory array starts at length 1 and expands as needed.
            </p>

            <p>
                The eight language commands each consist of a single character:
            </p>

            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Character</th>
                    <th>Instruction Performed</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><code>&gt;</code></td>
                    <td>Increment the data pointer by one (to point to the next cell to the right).</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><code>&lt;</code></td>
                    <td>Decrement the data pointer by one (to point to the next cell to the left).</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><code>+</code></td>
                    <td>Increment the byte at the data pointer by one. </td>

                    <td>Decrement the byte at the data pointer by one. </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><code>.</code></td>
                    <td>Output the byte at the data pointer.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><code>,</code></td>
                    <td>Accept one byte of input, storing its value in the byte at the data pointer.</td>

                    <td><code>[</code></td>
                    <td>If the byte at the data pointer is zero, then instead of moving the instruction pointer forward
                        to the next command, jump it forward to the command after the matching <code>]</code> command.

                    <td>If the byte at the data pointer is nonzero, then instead of moving the instruction pointer
                        forward to the next command, jump it back to the command after the matching <code>[</code>
                        command.</td>

            <h2>Features of this debugger</h2>

            <h3>Control buttons</h3>
            <p>
                There are 3 buttons: start/stop, step and continue. Start will start running the program, stop will
                terminated it without further notice. Step will start start debugging the program, but will pause on
                first instruction. If the program is already running, step will step over instruction by instruction.
                Continue button will continue the execution, but will pause on next breakpoint.
            </p>

            <h3>Program window</h3>
            <p>
                Program window contains the executing code. All comment symbols are grayed out. Next instruction to be
                executed is highlighted in red. Any instruction can be clicked to toggle a breakpoint or ctrl-clicked to
                immediately jump to the instruction.
            </p>

            <h3>Standard IO</h3>
            <p>
                Input fields for standard io are provided, program input and program output. Both can be resized. Output
                is readonly. Input can be freely written to, when program is paused. Press ctrl+enter to submit text.
                When the program requests input (using , operator), a single character of input from the beginning of
                the line is consumed. If no input is available, program will be paused until you input something.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are 3 modes of display for standard IO:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Text: stream is displayed as sequence of ASCII characters.</li>
                <li>Decimal: stream is displayed as a space-separated sequence of decimal numbers.</li>
                <li>Hex: stream is displayed as a space-separated sequence of hex numbers. Numbers are padded to 2
                    symbols.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Memory</h3>
            <p>
                Memory contents of the program is displayed. Each column is a single cell. Head position is displayed as
                square brackets. Header index can be clicked to move the head around.
            </p>
            <p>
                Other 3 rows contain the same data, but in different forms. ASCII tries to interpret data as ASCII
                characters, but will fail if codepoint is not printable. Hex and decimal will always display correct
                data. Any of these fields can be edited.
            </p>

            <h3>Errors</h3>
            <p>
                Any runtime errors will be reported. Here is a
                comprehensive list of all errors:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>program exceeded 1000000 steps - there is a hard cap of 1 million steps per program</li>
                <li>head pointer underflow - head pointer was moved leftwards of the 0 index</li>
                <li>head pointer underflow - head pointer was moved leftwards of the 0 index</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                These errors should be unreachable to the end user, because form data is sanitized:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>input string is not a single character - operator ',' received more then one character</li>
                <li>non ascii input - operator ',' received a multi-byte character</li>
                <li>input number is not a byte - operator ',' received a number that overflows or underflows 8 unsigned
                    bits
                </li>
                <li>out of bounds jump - compiled BF bytecode specifies a jump to unknown address</li>
                <li>invalid jump - compiled BF bytecode specifies a jump to the current instruction</li>
            </ul>
